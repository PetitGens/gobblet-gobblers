# Gobblet-Gobblers

This program is a digital version of Gobblet Gobblers (a Tic-Tac-Toe like board game).  
It was made in C during my IT studies at Caen for a learning project.
After the end of this project, I continued enhancing the game during my free time.

## Rules of the game

The this game's rules are very similar to Tic Tac Toe's, with some additions :
* Each player has pieces of different sizes : SMALL, MEDIUM and HARD.
* The players have limited pieces (2 for each size).
* A piece can be placed over another if it is strictly bigger.
* You can place pieces on the board, but you can also move one of your pieces that are already on it.
