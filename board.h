 * \section descritpion Description of the project
 * This project is aimed to implement a two player game, 
 * close to the Tic-Tac-Toe game. 
 * The rules of the games are described below.
 * 
 * The project is divided into various files. Mostly, the engine of the game,
 * implementing the detailed rules, is provided in the files board.c and board.h
 *
 * \section rules Detailed rules of the game.
 * 
 * The game is played by two players on a three by three squares board, 
 * though variants may be played on larger boards 
 * (in particular on a four by four board for gobblets).
 * Each player has control of a set of six pieces whose owner is easily 
 * identifiable, for example by the shape or the color of the piece.
 * The pieces are of three different
 * sizes (big, medium, small), each player having two of each size. 
 * 
 * During the course of the game, players alternately make a move that consists 
 * in either:
 * - adding a piece from their collection on the board.
 * - moving one of his visible pieces already on the board to another square.
 * 
 * A piece can be placed either on an empty square, 
 * or on a square containing only smaller pieces, 
 * independently of who owns the piece.
 * In that latter case, the piece covers and hides the smaller pieces.
 * When a piece placed over other pieces is moved from a square, 
 * the largest piece covered is revealed and can be played in a later turn.
 * 
 * The game is won by the first player who manages to make a visible line of 
 * his pieces across the board (on a line, a column, 
 * or a diagonal, like for Tic-Tac-Toe.)
